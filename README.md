## The Triforce

The **Triforce**, also known as:

- the **Golden Power** *(ALttP)*  
- the **Master Force** *(ALttP)*  
- **Prime Energy** *(EoW)*  
- the **Ultimate Power** *(SS)*

is a sacred golden relic left behind by the Golden Goddesses — **Din**, **Nayru**, and **Farore** — after they completed the creation of the realm that would become known as **Hyrule**.

The **Goddess Hylia** was entrusted with the duty of safeguarding both the world and the Triforce. However, after her rebirth as a mortal, the responsibility of its protection was passed down to the **Royal Family of Hyrule**, the **Sages**, and the **Sheikah**.

The **Triforce** symbolizes

- $${\color{green}Courage}$$, often residing in the Hero of Hyrule, Link
